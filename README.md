# Testing generalization bounds for MLPs

Derived novel generalization bounds (see report [here](http://kushaltirumala.github.io/ACM_270_Final_Report.pdf)), implemented optimizer based on terms in bound (see `new_optimizer.py`) and compared against L2 regularization on standard datasets (CIFAR10, MNIST, etc.)
